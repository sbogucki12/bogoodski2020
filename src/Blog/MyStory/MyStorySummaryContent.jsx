                <div>I'm Steve Bogucki, pronounced "Bo-Good-Ski" (ahhâ€¦ it all makes sense now?), and I want to sincerely thank you for your interest in what I'm building here.  And I also want to acknowledge the arrogance an autobiography like this demonstrates.  I'm not a celebrity, have never invented anything of note, and am no one's hero, so the fact that you're taking the time to consider reading any of this is significant to me. But I think it will be worth your while.  While the specific challenges I've experienced are unique to my life's story, we <i>all</i> have encountered obstacles. That I've mostly overcome mine might be a source of inspiration for those of you still dealing with your own. And the lessons I've learned may be beneficial in informing your own success strategy.</div> 
                <br />
                <div>I appreciate your interest, hope my story is both an enjoyable and valuable read, and welcome your contact should you want to get in touch.</div>
                <br />
